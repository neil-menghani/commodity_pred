Instructions for Running 3 Models:
1. Install and load the "readr" and "class" packages.
2. Ensure that the "comm_data.csv" and "weather_data.csv" files are in the same directory as the R scripts.
2. Run each of the following R scripts:
	Momentum Model: "momentum.R"
	Regression Model: "regression.R"
	K-Nearest Neighbors Model: "knn.R"
3. Each of these models will load the datasets, implement the corresponding models, and output Annual Returns and Sharpe Ratio over 4 periods for each.

Notes: Our passive index Returns and Sharpe Ratio are calculated in Excel in the document title "SP500.csv". Our presentation for class is the file called "Neil_Steven_MATHV3050_Project.pdf". The additional data files in the "comm" folder are the files from which we extracted our data. The only necessary data files for running the code, however, are "comm_data.csv" and "weather_data.csv".
